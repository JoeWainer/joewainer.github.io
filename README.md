## Bridging People and Technology

Hi, I'm Joe. A Technical Witer. My goal is to make technology easier for everyone to understand.

After years of writing reviews and content articles about tech, I decided it's time to start helping people by making technology more accessible. And the best way to do that was to become a Technical Writer. 

Below are my technical documentation projects, skills, completed courses, and education.

## Open Weather Map API 

This [API document](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Joe99/WeatherMapAPI/2.5) is built according to the OpenAPI 3.0 specification and written in YAML. I built this API as part of an online API documentation course. It's written and hosted on [SwaggerHub](https://swagger.io/). 

With this API you can get: 
* The current weather, daily forecast for 16 days, and a three-hour-interval forecast for 5 days for your city. 
* Helpful stats, graphics, and this day in history charts are available for your reference. 
* Interactive maps show precipitation, clouds, pressure, wind around your location stations. 
* Data is available in JSON, XML, or HTML format.

## Therapist Bot App and Documentation 

I wrote the code for a therapist bot as part of an online course in JavaScript, plus documentation detailing each function, constant, and enumeration. 

You can try the [working demo](https://joewainer.github.io/therapist-bot/) and [view the code on GitHub](https://github.com/JoeWainer/therapist-bot/blob/main/index.html). I created the [document](https://github.com/JoeWainer/therapist-bot/blob/main/README.md) using Markdown.

## Stripe Record Usage API 

This [API document](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/JoeWainer/StripeUsageRecordsMock/2021-12-15/
) allows Stripe users to report customer usage and metrics to stripe for metered billing of subscription prices. 

I wrote the API document as part of a course on OpenAPI specification and Swagger. The project was to recreate the [record usage section](https://stripe.com/docs/api/usage_records) from Stripe's documentation.
