## OpenWeatherMap API 

This [API documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Joe99/WeatherMapAPI/2.5) is built according to the OpenAPI 3.0 specification and written in YAML. I built this API as part of an online API documentation course. It's written and hosted on [SwaggerHub](https://swagger.io/). 

With this API you can get the current weather, daily forecast for 16 days, and a three-hour-interval forecast for 5 days for your city. Helpful stats, graphics, and this day in history charts are available for your reference. Interactive maps show precipitation, clouds, pressure, wind around your location stations. Data is available in JSON, XML, or HTML format.
