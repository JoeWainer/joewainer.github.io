## OpenWeatherMap API 

This [API documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Joe99/WeatherMapAPI/2.5) is built according to the OpenAPI 3.0 specification and written in YAML. I built this API as part of an online API documentation course. It's written and hosted on [SwaggerHub](https://swagger.io/). 

With this API you can get the current weather, daily forecast for 16 days, and a three-hour-interval forecast for 5 days for your city. Helpful stats, graphics, and this day in history charts are available for your reference. Interactive maps show precipitation, clouds, pressure, wind around your location stations. Data is available in JSON, XML, or HTML format.

## Stripe Record Usage API 

This [API document](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/JoeWainer/StripeUsageRecordsMock/2021-12-15/
) allows Stripe users to report customer usage and metrics to stripe for metered billing of subscription prices. 

I wrote the API document as part of a course on OpenAPI specification and swagger. The goal was to recreate the [Record Usage section](https://stripe.com/docs/api/usage_records) fron Swipe's documenation in Swagger.
